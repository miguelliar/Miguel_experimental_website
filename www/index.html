                <h2>Relationship with nature</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p> Since I was a child I've always loved nature. I fortunately live in Asturias where
                        having grass fields, forests, wildlife and beautiful landscapes around you is as easy as
                        looking around. I also have been living in a small and quiet village, 15 minutes away
                        from Oviedo, that helped me to connect with my environment and love where I live.</p>
                    <p> In my free time admiring the beauty of nature, no matter if it's cloudy, rainy and
                        grey or sunny and full of life is one of my most favourite ways of disconnect from the
                        stress and leave my mind free.</p>

                <h2>Photography background</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                        Given the love for nature I feel, it almost feels as compulsory to search the
                        partial preservation of its beauty. My father always loved photography too and
                        thanks to him, I have some albums of old photos that remind me of my childhood
                        and a hobby that I practice casually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The things I like taking photos the most are landscapes, sunsets and portraits.
                        Here, you can see one picture I took from my window:

                <h2>Walking around</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                        Loving nature is a perfect complement with loving walking. Going into mountains,
                        routes, discovering new places, feeling the wind while walking and enjoying
                        brief pauses admiring the landscape are some of many thrills of walking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, one of my favourite experiences was the "Camino de Santiago". I've
                        done it two different times by two different paths, the coast and the interior path.
                        It was an awesome experience, full of joy, meeting new amazing people and having
                        amazing experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are some photos taken on both journeys:

                <h2>Drawing and painting</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                        Writing about my hobbies and the things I love and not mentioning drawing
                        and painting would feel like going to the beach and not eating ice cream.
                        Painting and specially drawing has always been a way of expressing my feelings
                        and way of living things. I've been drawing since I could grab a pen
                        and despite having seasons of being more productive or creative, it may be
                        the only hobby that I actually maintain actively for a that long period of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I went to public painting activities in the public library from the age of 4
                        to 7 and after that I went to private classes. Since then until I was 18 years
                        old I attended to Oviedo to an artist that taught me almost everything I know
                        today. She taught me to paint in oil, improve my drawing and depth perception
                        and to be constant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays I don't have all time I would like to draw and paint, but I try to
                        keep on with it and spend some time every few weeks at least.

                <h2>Traveling</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                        Who doesn't like to travel? Well, in my case I am very fortunate as I started
                        traveling with my family very soon. We usually made day trips or take small
                        vacations in different parts of Spain. I have very good memories about those
                        trips. Even more, at the age of 10, my mother-part family started making
                        cruise vacations and, fortunately, I was able to go with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We went through a great part of the Mediterranean sea, we went through the
                        Norwegian fjord, the Baltic sea and the Atlantic sea. Until 2017 we visited
                        almost every place in a cruise ship. However, despite the privilege that it
                        was, you could only visit certain parts of the city. You could not appreciate
                        the totality of the places, getting with a small picture of some gorgeous cities
                        and places.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2017 I made my last travel with my family. We went to Thailand and my mother
                        organized every aspect of the vacations. It was an unforgettable experience.
                        We stayed for two weeks and visited Bangkok, the island of Phuket and Chiang Mai.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last time I went out of Spain was in 2018, where I went to visit a friend in
                        Abu Dhabi in Arabia Saudi, where I stayed for a week and a half during Christmas.
                        It was the first time I traveled abroad alone, and I loved it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, due to the pandemic and lack of time I haven't been able to travel as much as
                        I would like. However, I am looking forward to visiting and staying more time in
                        new places and discover its culture, gastronomy and history (and making a travel journal).

                    <p>
                        Despite being an only child, my family is huge on both sides of the tree. On the
                        one hand, we have my mother family from Asturias. They are 5 direct brothers and
                        many other members (which I don't know or remember well). I live close to all them,
                        and they work together in a family business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, we have my father family from Andalucía. They are distributed over
                        all Andalucía, but they usually stay near Seville where we met every holiday. They are
                        5 brothers too and everyone has a child around my age, so I spend a lot of time with
                        them.
